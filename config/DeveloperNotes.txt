TO BE DONE
1. in the Checklist module view must be changed
2. in the Album module different database should be used but for the moment we will use the same database as Checklist todolist
3. Write a service against an interface

    create an interface

    !!An invokable is a class that can be constructed without any arguments.
    'invokables' => array(
                 'Blog\Controller\List' => 'Blog\Controller\ListController'
             )
    !!A factory is a class that creates instances of another class.  .
        'factories' => array(
                     'Blog\Controller\List' => 'Blog\Factory\ListControllerFactory'
                 )

     create a factory
     Factory classes always need to implement the Zend\ServiceManager\FactoryInterface
